Welcome to AstroConda's documentation!
======================================

AstroConda is a free software repository maintained by the `Space Telescope Science Institute <http://www.stsci.edu/>`_ (STScI) in Baltimore, Maryland. This repository provides tools and utilities commonly used by the astronomical community.

The components provided through the `astroconda <http://ssb.stsci.edu/astroconda>`_ channel on `ssb.stsci.edu <http://ssb.stsci.edu>`_ include most of the tools the user needs to work with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) data and data from other telescopes in a single Anaconda Python environment.  Each of the components contains sets of packages which have also been built and tested to ensure that they work with each other in the same environment.

To receive AstroConda announcements, or to engage in general discussion, feel free to subscribe to our `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/astroconda>`_.
